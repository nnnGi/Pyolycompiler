# Pyolycompiler

This PolyCompiler is inspired by https://github.com/evanzhoudev/polycompiler written in Node JS.
This project is written in Python, and ultimately, the polyglot method used here is double comment parasite polyglot,
unlike the original, which used a combination of various methods.

Input:
```python3
python3 polycompiler in.py in.js out.poly
```

This Project will take in a ```Python (.py)``` and ```Javascript (.js)``` file and output a ```.poly``` file which can be run in both languages using

```node {file name}.poly```
and
```python3 {file name}.poly```
respectively.

Requirements:
 - *Node JS*
 - *Python 3*
